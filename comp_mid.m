function Q = comp_mid(f,a,b,n)
% MID_QUAD This function implements the midpoint rule to compute integrals
% numerically. 
%       A = MID_QUAD(f,a,b,n) computes the approximation of the integral of
%       f by using the midpoint rule. The inputs to the function are the
%       function handle f, the endpoints a and b, and the number of
%       subdivisions n. The function implements quadrature using piecewise
%       constant functions for numerical integration.
%
%       Limits to the Method Below and Ways to Improve
% 
%       The "Original Code" below uses a "for" loop, which restricts the number of
%       subdivisions that can be used to approximate the integral, even
%       though the function is only several lines of code. Improvement can be
%       achieved, I think with the use of more linear algebra to implement
%       the use of matrix multiplication, which is well suited for MATLAB.
%       Other ways to improve this code is to implement an input for
%       tolerance, so as to quantify how accurate the code is and so it can
%       be compared with other quadrature methods.
%
%       Updates
%
%       The code was re-written without using "for" loops. A comparison was
%       made using y = sin(x), a = 0, b = pi, and N = 10000. For this test run,
%       the updated code was over 100 times faster than the original code.
