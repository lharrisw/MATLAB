    % Newton-Cotes Weight Determination
    %
    % This code determines the weights for Newton-Cotes methods for any
    % number of nodes N. This also takes in the endpoints a and b as
    % inputs. The number of nodes must be no less than two. Further, having
    % zero as an endpoint provides a poor result from integrating the
    % interpolant, hence the error message for zero being an endpoint. This
    % code also works for any two reasonable endpoints, and as of right
    % now, reasonable means not too big and not too small.
